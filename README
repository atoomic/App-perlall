This archive contains the distribution App::perlall

Create perls and test with all perls

perlall -v help

Naming scheme: d DEBUGGING, -nt non-threaded, -m multi, @ git id

Configuration in source-able shell script ~/.perlall

You might want to link perlall to a valid command with "-command" appended
  perlall-make perlall-do perlall-cpan perlall-maketest...
but options handling is tricky then.

I always disliked perlbrew, this is better.
